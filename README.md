# JackBlock
Jackblock is a `lottery blockchain game` build in Substrate.
Players can be rewarded with extra `coins` and `dynamic NFT's` hosted on `IPFS`.

### Rules in a nutshell:
- To participate in the game, `player can bet 6 numbers` within range `1 - 49`
- Each `bet costs 100 coins` and it's added to shared `session pot`
- Session is closed `every 24h`, then `6 magic numbers are announced`.
- Each player who bet some correct numbers, would be rewarded accordignly. All split rules are available here [Session pot split rules](https://github.com/korzewski/jackblock/wiki/Jackblock-session-pot-split-rules)
- Additionally each player has a chance to win a `unique NFT`
